How to develop data documentation



## Creating documentation

- follow the modify link on an existing page to go the .mdx file on github then make and commit changes
- create a new file in `/scr/docs/en` 

## adding images to documentation
save .svg and .png files in `/public`. The sub-folder structure can be automatically refactored, feel free to create new 
sub-folders
At present there are the following
- miro: exports of miro documents.
- erd: entity relationship diagrams
- logo: svg logo files
- tableau: for documenting tableau workbooks and guides
- databricks: for documenting databricks queries and guides
- assets: catch all for anything else

To add an image to an markdown file use the following code
'<img src="path relative to /public" alt="alt text description" />'


## Future Development
- enable search of the documentation.
- enable full screen popout when clicked for all images.
