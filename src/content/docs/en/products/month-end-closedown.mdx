title: Month End Closedown
description: "Recognize Revenue and Fees accrued during the month."
type: product
---

Revenues and Fees are accrued in four account types throughout the month. 
On the first of each month an automated job calculates the net change during the month and 
generates a Journal input which Operations manually Journal into the product.

Closedown Accrual Account Types:
* Trading Revenue
* Transaction Revenue
* Interest
* Fees

## Valid Account Type & Account Entry Type Pairings
Each Account Type has a set of valid Account Entry Types that are included in the closedown. 
All other Account Entries are flagged to Operations for reversal.The most common errors are 
<b>Correct Account  but incorrect Account Entry Type</b> and
<b>Incorrect Account but correct Account Entry Type</b>.

In both cases operations should reverse the Journal in kind and issue a new corrected Journal Transaction. Reversing,
rather than modifying the account entry type, provides Vitesse with a health metric around Journaling error.

## Operations Journaling
Operations may need to manually closedown an account if the account is disabled during the month. 
This should be done using the AccountEntry Type Closedown. Using a valid account entry type will result in the 
account transaction being reversed in month end job.

Operations should correct Journaling errors with the original account entry type. 
This ensures the net amount for the account entry type is zero. Closing errors down using a
different account entry type prevent aggregate level reconciliation. If the product is developed 
so two journals can be linked then matching the account entry types is no longer necessary.


## Residual Balance
When the month end process was carried out manually errors were introduced leaving
non-zero balances in accounts. These residual values need to either be written off 
or recognized as fees and revenue through a manual process.


## Future Development
* Remove the manual step of Operations Journaling the ledger movements.
* Automate the Cash Movements.
