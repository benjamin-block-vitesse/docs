# Git guide
The goal of this guide is twofold:
1. Improve consistency when multiple analysts are working on a codebase; and
2. Provide a framework that decreases the number of decisions that need to be
made

## Git branches
Git branches should:
* be named as follows:
  * feature/name-of-feature
  * fix/name-of-fix
  * refactor/name-of-refactor

### Branching strategy
Vitesse follows a [GitFlow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/version-control-best-practices/#identify-a-branching-strategy) branching strategy in which development occurs on the development branch, moves to a staging branch, and merges into the production branch.

## Commits
Commits should:
* have a message in the imperative sense â€“ a good way to frame this tense is to
  finish the sentence "this commit will ...". For example:
  * Add MRR models
  * Fix typo in sessions model description
  * Update schema to v2 schema syntax
  * Upgrade version of infrastructure to major.minor.patch
  * include [commit signature](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
* happen early and often! As soon as a piece of your code works, commit it! This
  means that if (/when), down the line, you introduce bad code, you can easily
  take your code back to the state it was in when it worked.

Commits can:
* be squashed on a local branch before being  pushed to your remote branch, if
  you feel comfortable doing this.
* include versioning in the commit message

### Tagging

Data uses [github-tag-action](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action) for version tagging. Tagging is applied to all repos but is most critical to the [Terraform Jobs Module](https://github.com/VitessePSP/terraform-databricks-jobs) and the python function wheel.

Tagging follows [major.minor.patch](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/major-minor-patch-a5298e2e1798) versioning. By default commits will bump the minor version. To control the versioning include  #major, #minor, #patch, in the commit message to trigger respective version bump. If two or more are present, the highest-ranking one will take precedence.

## Pull requests
Pull requests should:
* tackle a functional grouping of work. While it may be tempting to (for
  example) build MRR models _and_ add maintenance jobs in a single PR, these
  should be separate pieces of work.
* include a body that explains the context of the changes to the code, as well
  as what the code does. Useful things to include in a PR are:
  * Links to Azure DevOps Work Item or Github Issue
  * Links to data docs that explain any new piece of functionality you have
    introduced
  * A screenshot of the DAG for the new models you have built
  * Links to any related PRs (for example, if Tableau dependancy will need to be
    updated to reflect the changes in your models)
  * Explanation of any breaking changes
  * Any special instructions to merge this code, e.g. whether a full-refresh
    needs to be run, or any renamed models should be dropped. You can use a PR
    template to encourage others making PRs on the repo to do the same. An
    example PR template we often use on client work is included [here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-init/blob/master/starter-project/.github/pull_request_template.md)
* be merged by its _author_ when:
  * approval has been given by at least one collaborator
  * all tests have passed

Pull requests can:
* be used to collaborate on code, as they are a great way to share the code
  you've written so far. In this scenario, use a _draft_ pull request.
