description: "How to makes data requests"
---
Requests should be sent to central locations to enable the data team to track and classify issues.
Please use the official channels rather than messaging individual member of the Data team.

## Slack Users
Post your request in [#ask-data](https://vitessepsp.slack.com/archives/C05LZH09QRY). 
The Data Team will triage the request and all communications will be in the slack thread you started.

Data will either:
* redirect you to the documentation
* generate a freshdesk ticket
  * for small ad-hoc fixes and issues which need to be addresses as part of data operations.
* generate a work item in Azure DevOps
  * large requests which need to be scoped and prioritized.

Ticket and Work Item progress is automatically reported into the Slack channel.
