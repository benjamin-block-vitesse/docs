Trust Balance for each Customer Account.
* Output is sent to Operations who post a Journal to the Vitesse Application and carry out the cash movement.
<br/><br/>
<b>When the Customer Interest Rates are updated the Trust Management Product:</b>
* Recalculates the interest rates for dates on or after the effective start date of new interest rates.
<br/><br/>
<b>End of Each Day:</b>
* Identifies Customer Accounts with negative E-Money balances and triggers an Emergency Repositioning for each Account
* Calculates the interest accrued for each Customer Account updating the data model tables.

## Entity Relationships
There are five entity relationships that make up Trust. 
None of the relationships are defined in the Vitesse application.
The relationships are defined in csv files owned by Finance(Mark Oâ€™Brien).
Only Standard Product Accounts are eligible for Trust. FCP, MSF, and ABM accounts are not eligible.


| Entity 1         | Entity 2      | Relationship | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trust Bank       | Standard Bank | One-To-One   | When Trust Balance is repositioned Funds the Trust Bank is debited/credited while the Standard Bank is credited/debited. The relationship is <span style="color:red">not defined</span> in the Vitesse Application. |
| Trust Bank       | Customer      | Many-to-One  | Each Trust Bank is associated with a single Customer which is <span style="color:red">not defined</span> in the Vitesse Application                                                                                 |
| Customer Account | Customer      | Many-to-One  | Customer Accounts are associated with a single customer which is <span style="color:orange">inferred</span> in the Vitesse Application                                                                              |
| Customer Account | Trust Bank    | Many-to-Many | Customer Accounts are associated with one or Trust Bank Accounts. The relationship and the percentage of Funds for a given relationship are <span style="color:red">not defined</span> in the Vitesse Application.  |
| Customer         | Interest Rate | One-to-Many  | Interest Rates are set at the Customer, Currency, and Bank grain. The interest rates are <span style="color:red">not defined</span> in the Vitesse Application                                                      |

### Example Relationships
In Diagram 1
* Two of the Customer Accounts have a 50%/50% `Trust Split` between two Trusts.
  * The `Trust Split` can include infinite Trusts each with split percentage between 0.01% and 99.9%. 
    * `Great Expectations` validates that the `Trust Split` for a given Customer Account sum to 100%.
* One of the Customer Accounts is ineligible for Trust. eg. a FCP or ABM account.
In Diagram 2
* One Customer has three accounts in a given currency each with linked to a different Trust Account.
  * Sedgwick, Sedgwick Ageas, and Sedgwick Zurich follow this pattern.

### Exception Tagging
<p>Zurich, Ageas are a subset of Sedgwick which exists only for trust purposes. The Trust and Customer Accounts have been 
  tagged as Zurich and Ageas.</p>

<p>ABM Accounts are not Trust Eligible and have been tagged and used to define lakehouse Customer Account product type.</p>

<p>The assumption in Operations and Finance is that ABM and Sedgwick's Zurich and Ageas Sub-Customers are a legacy product 
and no new accounts will be created.
Therefore, only historical accounts will be tagged; 
Vitesse is choosing not to tag all account to ensure no ABM or Sedgwick Sub-Customers are untagged.
No one is able to validate that new accounts were created as anything untagged must be assumed to be non-ABM, non-Ageas
  , and non-Zurich.</p>


## Customer Interest Payments
Vitesse has agreed an Interest Sharing Schema with the Customer on Funds Held in Trust.
The Annual Interest Rates Customers earn by Currency change over time. The Table records the valid period for each Interest Rate and is maintained by Finance.


## Future Development
* Automation of the Account Movement currently done through Journaling.
* Automation of the Cash Movement manually carried out by Ops.
* Entity refactory of the Vitesse Application to support Trust amongst other requirements.
