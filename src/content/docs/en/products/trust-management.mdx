## Customer Trust Interest
For Customers with Trust Accounts Vitesse has agreed an Interest Sharing Schema with the Customer.
The Annual Interest Rates Customers earn by Currency change over time. The Table records the valid period for each Interest Rate and is maintained by Finance. See [Trust Interest](https://github.com/VitessePSP/data-analytics-pipeline/wiki/TrustInterest)for details on how Interest Values are calculated.
