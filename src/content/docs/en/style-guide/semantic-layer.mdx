## SQL model
- Use lowercase SQL
- Put each selected column on its own line
- Indent where conditions
- Left align SQL keywords
- Use single quotes
- Use `!=` over `<>`
- Commas should be at the the end of lines
- Break long lists of `in` values into multiple indented lines
- [Group by using numbers](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1/)


### Example SQL

```sql
with batch as (
    select
        BatchId as batch_id,
        JobId as job_id,
        AccountId as bank_account_id,
        GbpValue as payment_in_gbp,
        BankJobStatus as job_status,
        BatchStatus as batch_status,
        AutoProcessed as auto_processed,
        BatchCreatedOn as batch_created_on
    from gold.payment.batch_ltd
),

batch_entry as (
    select
        BatchId as batch_id,
        Succeeded as succeeded,
        FailureReason as failure_reason,

        sum(Amount) as payment_amount,
        count(BatchEntryId) as payment_count
    from gold.payment.batch_details_ltd
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
),

final as (
    select *,
    (case
        when auto_processed is false and batch_status ="Completed" then "Manual"
        when auto_processed is true and batch_status ="Completed" then "STP"
    end) as processing_type,
    (case when batch_status ="Completed" then payment_in_gbp else null end) as total_payment_in_gbp,
