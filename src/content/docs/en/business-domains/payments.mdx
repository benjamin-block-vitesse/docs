# Batching
Payments are not processed one at a time, but rather grouped together and sent to Banks in Batches. Closing a batch and send it to a bank is trigged by either maximum number of transactions, maximum time the batch can be open, or manually processed by Ops.


# Banking Job
Once a batch is completed it is processed as a banking job.

## Reconciliation
The Vitesse Application does not capture the individual transaction status in the Product. A third party allication, Duco, 
reconciles the vitesse payment instructions with the bank cash movements.
