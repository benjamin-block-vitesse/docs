Product Health was attempted once before focusing on transaction throughput metrics rather than product feature health 
usage metrics. Product health needs to be redesigned from the ground up; the below is based on business domains as defined by data. 
Requires review with Guy Gibbs to agree on scope; work is not committed in the data road map.

* A suite of health metrics needs to be proposed by the sponsor or owner of each new microservice.


## Customer and Account Management
* Account Status provides insight into activity and usage.
  * Will highlight the issue we have closing accounts.
* ReportingName not aligned with Salesforce
* TPAs (additional alias) not aligned with Salesforce
* On-boarding microservice usage
* FCP blend gaps

## Funding
The Product Team is developing the documentation to identify the various funding types used within the Vitesse Application.
* Funding Mechanism
* Unapplied resolutions done without split Journaling


## Ledger
Majority of AccountEntry issues are due to Journaling. 
However, there are instances where Dev incorrectly configures a new feature; 
AccountEntry monitoring should not be exclusive to Journaling.
* invalid AccountType, AccountEntryType, and Is Debit pairings.
* Revenue entries do not reconcile between Merchant, MerchantInvoice and TransactionRevenue Accounts.
* Payment entries do not reconcile between Merchant and Bank Accounts.

## Pricing
* Non-invoiceable
* Customer Accounts with different pricing configurations
* Payments without Fees

## Batching
Reroutes, failures, time-to-process

## Transaction Requests
invalid, time-to-process


## Microservices
