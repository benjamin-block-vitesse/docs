## Route & Recipient
Dimension tables identifying the Bank Route, Recipient dimensions, and are used to calculate the Clearing Type. 

## Clearing Types
No data around Clearing Type is transmitted from the payment to the platform. The most probable Clearing Type for a given route were defined by the pricing team. If the table does not contain a entery matching the route the Clearing Type is assumed to be "International- Destionation CCY"

## Requests Types
1. Single Payment
Customers request a single payment using the Single Payment Interface.

2. Merchant Batch
Customers upload a Batch of payments using the Batch Interface. Batch size by Customer is a key metric to understand usage.

3. API

API payments are inferred rather than explicitly defined in SM. Any TransactionRequestIds not present in Single Payment or Merchant Batch tables is classified as API. 
Host to Host is a SubType of API. Awaiting Dev to provide means of identification.
